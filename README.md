## Introduction
This repository contains R and SAS codes used in a multinational cohort study based on mother-child linkage data titled, "Maternal diabetes and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in offspring: a multinational population-based cohort study". The R and SAS codes included here were used to conduct the statistical analysis using propensity score fine stratification based on a cleaned dataset following the common data model. These codes are intended to provide transparency and reproducibility of the study results, and can be used as a reference for similar studies in the future. Please refer to the documentation in the repository for further information on the data used, methods employed, and results obtained. This readme file explains the specification of the R codes. 
# Systematic requirements
R version 4.0.3 (October, 2020)  -- "Lost Library Book" Copyright (C) 2021 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)
# Imput data demo
The demo of the input data can be found in the data folder, where the data structures and a synthetic demo of the inputs are provided. Before running the preprocessing codes, make sure the input data format is  same as the provided input demo.
One cleaned dataset based on the common data model was used in this study, namely:
    1. data1.csv: mother-child linkage database with exposure, outcome, follow-up time, and all covariates.
# Instruction for use
